# ElasticSearch

In an example, like LinkedIn when we can search in multiple ways.

`Parameterized Search` - When we search on the basis of some parameters, like organizations, user. What we usually do here is that
we have a table organizations and we will have column Organization Name what would match this parameter we would pass.
